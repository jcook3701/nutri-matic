## [0.1.6] - 2025-12-18

### ⚙️  Miscellaneous

- *(version)* Version update to 1.6!

### 🐛 Fixed

- *(build)* Forgot to add virtual environment source for bump-my-version command.

### 🚀 Added

- *(hooks)* Added make.py to hooks so that different make commands can be chosen within the cookiecutter.json file rather than needing to template a ton for each variance of make commands that need to be run per-template.  I also refactored the make_dirs command out of hooks/utils and moved it to the core/utils directory.
