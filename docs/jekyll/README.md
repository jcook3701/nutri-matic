## Command Examples:
### 🔧 nutrimatic (add_docs, extract, run, list)

    --repo git@github.com:jcook3701/python3-cookiecutter.git \
    --branch develop \
    --output clean_cookiecutter.json
```

#### Run:
__Description:__ Run a cookiecutter template using a pre-supplied JSON configuration file.

```

#### List:
__Description:__ List available cookiecutter templates under a namespace.
```shell

```

***

### ⚙️ Config (nm-config)
__Description:__ nutrimatic configuration tools.
__Note:__ These are tools that are used to manage package configuration file.

#### Sub-commands: (show)

#### Show:
__Description:__
```shell
$ nm-config show
```

***

### 🔨 Build (nm-build)
__Description:__ Cookiecutter build automation utilities.
__Note:__ These commands are intended to be used within project Makefiles as build tools. Examples will assume for use in Makefile.
#### Sub-commands: (readme, add-yaml-front-matter)

#### Readme:
__Description:__ Generates project readme from projects github-docs jekyll project.  The intention is keep the readme within ./docs/jekyll as the projects single source of truth.
__Note__: Replace with real values.
```shell
PROJECT_ROOT := $(PWD)
DOCS_DIR := $(PROJECT_ROOT)/docs
JEKYLL_DIR := $(DOCS_DIR)/jekyll
JEKYLL_BUILD := bundle exec jekyll build --quiet
README_GEN_DIR := $(JEKYLL_DIR)/tmp_readme

readme:
  nm-build readme $(JEKYLL_DIR) ./README.md \
	  --tmp-dir $(README_GEN_DIR) --jekyll-cmd '$(JEKYLL_BUILD)'
```

#### add-yaml-front-matter:
__Description:__ This adds yaml-front-matter to the head of (md, yml, & yaml) files to help beautify github docs.  Intended to be used with [github-docs-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jcook3701/github-docs-cookiecutter)
```shell
$ nm-build add-yaml-front-matter
```

## 🍪 Template (nm-templates)
__Description:__ nm-templates tools.
__Note:__ github-docs-cookiecutter will either be moved to [cc-templates](https://github.com/jcook3701/cc-templates) or be added to cc-templates as a submodule.  #### Sub-commands: (generate)

#### Generate:
__Description:__ This is for custom Cookiecutter template ([cc-templates](https://github.com/jcook3701/cc-templates)) that utilizes ccmeta.toml files to organize projects.
__Note:__ This feature is still in development.  __(Use at your own risk!!!)__
__Arguments:__
  * repo: Path to the template repository to generate README.md and Makefile
```shell
$ nm-templates generate $(repo)
```

## Development Strategy
__Note:__ All Makefile commands are used in ci/cd to ensure that if they pass locally they should also pass once pushed to github.

``` shell
$ make lint-check
```
``` shell
$ make lint-fix
```

## 🍹Authors Notes:
Their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws.


### TODO's:
1. cc-templates/ccindex.toml
  * create/update this file using the individual ccmeta.toml files in cc-templates
2. Finish updating this.readme with command usage.
3. Readme ```make readme``` should end up being a ci/cd process to ensure it is always up to date.
4. Thinking about adding a ci/cd process for version bumping.  To create a git tag.

### Future Design Decisions:
1. I need to decide whether to change all my current Cookiecutter projects to use the prefix ```cc-``` and use them as submodules within the [cc-templates](https://github.com/jcook3701/cc-templates) repository.  Or to just move the code directly into the cc-templates repository and use it as a monolithic repo.


<!--

2. Need to come up with a new name as ccutils and cc-utils are giving me issues on either pypi or testpypi.
  * Thinking of going with Hitch Hikers Guide to Galaxy based names as this is becoming rediculious.


🧣📖🤖🧑‍🚀👽✨🚀🛸🪐🍹🧃

cc-utils -> slartibartfast, improbability_drive, probability_engine, hyperjumps
cc-templates -> ~~Magrathea~~, restaurant_at_end_of_universe, life_universe_everything

slartibartfast -> src -> fjord
slartibartfast -> Magrathea

SubEtha -> Messaging system.  Good Open Name. (should claim)

To replace cc-utils:
  1. ✅ HeartOfGold
  2. ✅ heart_of_gold, (claim)
  3. ❌ ImprobCore
  4. ✅ improbability_core (claim)
  5. ✅ improb_core
  6. ✅ robot_marvin
To replace cc-templates:
  1. ❌ NutriMatic
  2. ✅ nutri_matic (claim)

__Notes:__
##### Project Theme (Hitch Hikers Guide the Galaxy)
"Don't Panic."
"The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't."
"The answer to the great question...of Life, the Universe and Everything...is...forty-two."
"For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen."
"I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be".
"The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move".

##### Heart of Gold (cc-utils)
1. “Hi there! This is Eddie, your shipboard computer, and I’m feeling just great, guys, and I know I’m just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any program you care to run through me.”

2. “That ship?” said Ford in sudden excitement. “What happened to it? Do you know?” “It hated me because I talked to it.” “You talked to it?” exclaimed Ford. “What do you mean you talked to it?” “Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it,” said Marvin. “And what happened?” pressed Ford. “It committed suicide,” said Marvin, and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold.

##### Nuri-Matic (cc-utils)
“The Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it. When put to test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid which was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.”
